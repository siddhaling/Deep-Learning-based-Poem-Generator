Packages used
Numpy
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large,
multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level
mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
NumPy targets the CPython reference implementation of Python and gives functionality
comparable to MATLAB. Python bindings of the widely used computer vision library
OpenCV utilize NumPy arrays to store and operate on data.

Panda
pandas aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real
world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most
powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any
language.

Tensorflow
TensorFlow is a Python library for fast numerical computing created and released by
Google. It is a foundation library that can be used to create Deep Learning models
directly or by using wrapper libraries that simplify the process built on top of TensorFlow.

Keras
Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial
neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.
Keras contains numerous implementations of commonly used neural-network building
blocks such as layers, objectives, activation functions, optimizers, and a host of tools to
make working with image and text data easier to simplify the coding necessary for
writing deep neural network code. In addition to standard neural networks, Keras has
support for convolutional and recurrent neural networks.

PROCEDURE
1. Since the code is running on google colab, we can execute the code by running
all the cells one after the other.
2. Initially, upload the data set onto the drive.
3. In the second cell, to import the dataset which is in our drive, we have to copy the
path of the dataset and provide it there.
4. Then run the cells and get the output.
